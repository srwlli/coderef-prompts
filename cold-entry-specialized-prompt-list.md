# Cold Entry Specialized Follow-up Prompts

## Overview
These specialized prompts are designed to follow the initial cold-entry scan, providing exhaustive documentation for specific areas of the codebase. Each prompt generates detailed documentation that enables agents to work on any part of the codebase with deep understanding.

## Usage Notes
- Each prompt should be run after the initial cold-entry scan
- Prompts can be run independently based on project needs
- Documentation should be stored in a centralized location
- Regular updates should be scheduled as code evolves
- Cross-references between documents enhance understanding
